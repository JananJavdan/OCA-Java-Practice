    Major components of Java
• to do Java development one needs JDK (Java Development Kit)
• Oracle's JDK, OpenJDK, etc. - select version 1.8 or 17

• key commands provided by JDK:

• javac : converts .java source files into .class bytecode
• java : executes a program
• jar : java archive (packing files together)
• javadoc : for documentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
• in Java 8 and earlier, this was a subset of JDK
• JRE allows the user to run Java applications (no compiler)
• after Java 8, one just uses full JDK to run Java applications
