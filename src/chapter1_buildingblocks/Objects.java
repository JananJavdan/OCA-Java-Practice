public class Objects {
    /*Creating objects

    object is an instance of the class

    (house â†’ blueprint)

    new object is created using a keyword new :

    Student s = new Student()

    when object is created, the constructor of the object is called

    // in file Student.java
public class Student {
public Student() {   >>>>   the constructor  >>> (like method, but no return type)
System.out.println("New student is created.");
 }
}

// in file MyApp.java        >>>>>   New student is created.
public class MyApp {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Student s = new Student();   >>>>> (new object is created and constructor is called)
 }
}

public class Student {
public void Student() {             >>>> (void) >>>  return type
System.out.println("New student is created.");
 }
}   here Student() is just a method, not a constructor
    (it will not be called when new object is created)

if you don't provide any constructor, the compiler will generate
simple no-argument constructor:   >>>   public Student() { }

public class Student {
String name;   >>> instance variable
public static void main(String[] args) {
Student s = new Student();   >>>>  creating an object
s.name = "John Wayne";   >>>>  set variable
System.out.println(s.name);   >>>>  get variable
 }
}
     */
